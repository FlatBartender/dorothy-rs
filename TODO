## TODO

- Use a persistent store for configuration variables in modules (example: see premade_creator)

### PremadeCreator

- Add commands to delete a game or a role from the list when configuring
- Usability: stop asking for IDs and get them from the command line. Serenity+serde should be able to handle this.
- Remove the Options on vecs and just use empty vecs
